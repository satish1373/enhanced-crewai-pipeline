## Description
### Comprehensive Test Report for Currency Converter Application

**Application URL tested:** [https://coin-swap-buddy.netlify.app](https://coin-swap-buddy.netlify.app)  
**Authentication results and status:**  
- **Success:** true  
- **Status Code:** 404  
- **Message:** Authentication successful  

**Test Execution Statistics**  
- **Total Tests Executed:** 0  
- **Tests Passed:** 0  
- **Tests Failed:** 0  
- **Tests Pending Verification:** 0  

**Analysis of Real Test Results**  
1. **Application Structure:** The application structure was not accessible, leading to a complete inability to perform UI tests. No forms, buttons, or UI elements could be identified due to consistent failures in accessing content.  
2. **Functional Tests:** No functional testing could be conducted as essential UI elements for currency conversion were not accessible.  
3. **Edge Case Results:** Edge case testing was not performed due to lack of access to input fields and the conversion functionality.  
4. **UI/UX Findings:** No UI/UX testing could be conducted as the application structure remained indiscernible.  
5. **Technical Evidence:** No screenshots or interactions could be captured as the application was not accessible.  
6. **Conversion Accuracy:** Verification of conversion calculations against known exchange rates was not possible.  

**Specific Findings**  
- The inability to access the application hindered all testing processes, and no direct interactions were performed.  
- Consequently, there were no results to verify or investigate further, resulting in a complete lack of test outcomes.  

**Actionable Recommendations**  
1. **Accessibility Improvement:** The development team should investigate the accessibility of the application's UI elements to ensure that testers can perform required functional tests.  
2. **Error Handling Implementation:** Implementation of better error handling for situations where the application may fail to load or provide feedback about inaccessible features would enhance user experience.  
3. **Stability Tests:** Once the issue is resolved, conduct stability tests to ensure the application can handle various edge cases, including invalid inputs and large amounts.
