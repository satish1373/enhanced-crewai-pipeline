  "title": "Test Report Update for Currency Converter Application",
  "description": "**Executive Summary of Test Results:**  \n- Total Test Scenarios: 5  \n- Passed: 0  \n- Failed: 5  \n\n**Detailed Analysis of Failures:**  \n1. **Valid Currency Conversions:**  \n   - **Scenario:** Tried converting between valid currency pairs (USD to EUR, JPY to GBP).  \n   - **Result:** **Failed** - Unable to access the converter functionality due to application being down.  \n\n2. **Invalid Input Handling:**  \n   - **Scenario:** Entered invalid currency codes (ABC to XYZ).  \n   - **Result:** **Failed** - Error handling could not be verified as the application was inaccessible.  \n\n3. **Form Validation:**  \n   - **Scenario:** Submitted empty form and invalid amount (negative values).  \n   - **Result:** **Failed** - Form validation could not be assessed due to application being down.  \n\n4. **Page Structure and Accessibility:**  \n   - **Scenario:** Checked for proper structure and accessibility features.  \n   - **Result:** **Failed** - Unable to extract structure details as the application is down.  \n\n5. **Response Accuracy and Error Handling:**  \n   - **Scenario:** Attempted to assess response accuracy for various conversions.  \n   - **Result:** **Failed** - No exchange rates or conversion outputs were accessible.  \n\n**Performance Observations and Recommendations:**  \n- The application is currently down, resulting in all tests failing.  \n- Recommended actions include checking the Docker container status, logs, and the .env file for any misconfigurations.  \n- Ensure that the application is healthy before attempting to conduct further testing.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe application is currently non-functional, and a health check is necessary to proceed with testing. Please address the deployment issues to enable further testing.",
